        testimonial: "It was nice reconnecting with people from my high school. I did not know that they also have art/craft hobbies too! I was also able to connect with a customer because they saw that I put \"K-Pop Lover\" on my IG bio. I asked them if they liked NewJeans (a newer kpop group, who has gained a lot of popularity), and they showed me their k-pop photocards from their bag! I love how we were able to connect on similar interests other than stationery too! Another cute story was when a customer came up to my shop, and they were already into sticker planning! The customer called me \"Sticker Costco\".",

        testimonial: "I absolutely loved the vibes! I think that everyone was amazing and talented, and there was great diversity in the types of art and vendors who were there. I was impressed by the amount of people who showed up, and I loved connecting with both vendors and just folks stopping by. I think the organizers did an incredible job, and were very responsive. The entire process was easy and simple. In particular I found the ability to hear from other artists about where else they vend and swap tips, etc was incredibly valuable as someone who's just starting out.",
